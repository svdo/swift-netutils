Swift library that simplifies getting information about your network interfaces and their properties, both for iOS, macOS and Linux.
This library is a wrapper around the BSD APIs like `getifaddrs`, to make it easy to use them from Swift.

Recommended way of integrating this library on macOS or iOS is using CocoaPods: https://cocoapods.org/pods/NetUtils. On Linux I recommend using the Swift Package Manager.

This library works with both Swift 3 and Swift 4.

## Background Info

Some system APIs you can simply use from Swift, but others you cannot. The difference is that some are made available
as a module, and some are not. The APIs around network interfaces are not exposed as a module, which means that you
cannot use them from Swift without defining a module for them yourself. I documented this problem extensively over
here: https://ind.ie/labs/blog/using-system-headers-in-swift.

## Installation

This library can be installed via CocoaPods, Carthage and Swift Package Manager.

## Usage

This module contains only one class: `Interface`. This class represents a network interface. It has a static method
to list all interfaces, somewhat surprisingly called `allInterfaces()`. This will return an array of `Interface`
objects, which contain properties like their IP address, family, whether they are up and running, etc.

Please note that both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces are supported.
